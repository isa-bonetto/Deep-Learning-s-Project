# Deep Learning's Project
The project focuses on the analysis of brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans for the detection of brain tumors using Deep Learning techniques. The dataset, downloaded from Kaggle, contains images divided into 44 classes: 14 types of tumors (each with three MRI sequences: T1, T1-CE, T2) and one normal class. The main goal is twofold: (1) reconstruct images using an autoencoder, and (2) classify tumors by using a pre-trained encoder with frozen weights. Image reconstruction enhances diagnostic quality, while automatic classification aims to support medical professionals in early diagnosis. The three MRI sequences provide complementary information: T1 highlights anatomical structures, T1-CE improves lesion visibility using contrast agents, and T2 detects areas with high water content. The sequences were combined to increase the model’s generalization ability and reduce overfitting. The project aims to deliver reliable and fast clinical support through neural networks trained on real medical data.
